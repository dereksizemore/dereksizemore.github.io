						<p class="about-p">My career in web design started when I wrote my first HTML web page in notepad in 2002. I got my first PC for Christmas a year earlier and it changed my life forever. I dove into a world of learning that scratched an itch I'd have for my entire life.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">My first major milestone was designing, coding, and maintaining my schools website with another classmate during my last 2 years of High School in 2007 and 2008. Before that I had just finished editing my first wordpress template through Upwork (formerly E-lance) as a freelancer in 2006. After High School I made a few web pages for college classmates projects in 2009 and 2010. My next major milestone was selling a web page to Circle P Whitetails while trying to start my business Derek's Web Pages in 2010. Finally, I worked on several freelance projects that consisted of building webpages with wordpress and other site-builders, updating content for static web pages, and designing graphics and logo's between 2011 and 2014.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">My career decisions and life choices have taken me away from web design at times, yet I always seem to find my way back. In April of 2022, I finished designing, coding, and implementing the first iteration of a brand and website, <a class="about-a" href="https://puapreserve.com">Pua Preserve</a>. This project has once again re-ignited my passion for development and started me on the path towards mastering Javascript and React. I pride myself on being an agile learner, passionate teacher, and persistent problem solver.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">I'm currently looking for a full time remote position in Web Development. I'm also interested in any entry level positions in Data Science using Python, Graphic Design, or Information Security. Here's a link to my <a class="about-a" href="resume">resume</a>. You can reach me by e-mail at <a class="about-a" href="mailto:dsize1990@gmail.com">dsize1990@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (918)315-0542.
