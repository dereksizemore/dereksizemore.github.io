						<p class="about-p">My career in technology started when I wrote my first HTML web page with notepad in 2002, diving into a world of learning that scratched an itch I would have my entire life. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I started a python Bootcamp through Udemy that lead me to crawl the SEC Edgar database, crunch fantasy football numbers with NumPy and display the data with Pandas, and reverse engineer a stock trading indicator that I like to use personally with async functions and socket libraries. Most recently, I launched the alpha version of a chrome extension that provides a solution to invoicing issues and other common problems faced by small businesses.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">My first major milestone was designing, coding, and maintaining a school website during my last 2 years of high school. After high school I made a few web pages for college classmates' projects and started working on a website for an idea I had for a business.  I worked on several freelance projects building pages with WordPress and other site-builders, updating content for static websites, and designing graphics and logos from 2011 to 2014.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">I like to align the values and knowledge I'm seeking with the career that I'm in. I worked in transportation for the physical activity it required and the self-discipline it instilled in me. I was able to lose more than 100 pounds over the course of 8 years. In sales I gained the confidence to be assertive and handle rejection. </p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">I enjoyed success in sales until the Covid-19 pandemic once again made me analyze my priorities. I've spent the last two-and-a-half years being an educator, mentor, and role model for the 3 most amazing children a step-father could ask for, while simultaneously teaching myself python, JavaScript (ES6), packages, APIâ€™s, and working on several personal projects.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">I take pride in my high learning agility and patience as a mentor. I have an unmatched work ethic and a desire to be part of something bigger than myself. I'm a self-motivated problem solver hungry for an opportunity to prove myself on the professional side of the tech world.</p>
						<br />
						<p class="about-p">I'm currently looking for a full time remote position in Web Development. I'm also interested in any entry level positions in Data Science using Python, Graphic Design, or Information Security. Here's a link to my <a class="about-a" href="resume">resume</a>. You can reach me by e-mail at <a class="about-a" href="mailto:dsize1990@gmail.com">dsize1990@gmail.com</a> or by phone at (918)315-0542.
