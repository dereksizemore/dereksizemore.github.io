					<p id="about-p">My career in web design started when I wrote my first HTML web page at 12 on a Windows 98 PC. I got that PC for christmas a couple years earlier and it changed my life forever. My first major milestone was co-designing, coding, and maintaining my schools website during my last 2 years of High School. The next milestone was editing my first wordpress template (before I could legally obtain a driver's license) through Upwork (formerly E-lance). </p>
					<p id="about-p">My career decisions and life choices have taken me away from web design at times, but I always seem to find my way back. I recently finished designing, coding, and implementing the first iteration of a brand and website, <a id="about-a" href="https://puapreserve.com">Pua Preserve</a>. This project has once again re-ignited my passion for development and design. I'm currently in the process of learning Javascript, Jquery, and Node.js as well as looking for solutions to ubiquitous problems that are inherent in any language.</p>
					<p id="about-p">I pride myself on being a quick, passionate, patient, and persistent learner, problem solver, and teacher.</p>
